## Problem Statement
The problem is to develop an Android application that can help farmers identify possible diseases in their plants. The app should be able to use image recognition and machine learning techniques to analyze images of the plants and identify any signs of disease or stress. The app should also provide information about the disease, including its causes, symptoms, and treatment options. The goal of the app is to help farmers detect and prevent diseases early, thereby reducing crop losses and improving yields.


The various modules include:
- Disease Prediction based on images.
- Weather Updates
- Chatbot for support
- Important Contacts
